This C++ project is a food order ATM simulation built on OOPS concepts. It uses classes, objects, and inheritance to manage food items, orders, and bills. The system offers a user-friendly menu, calculates costs, and generates receipts, effectively demonstrating core object-oriented principles in a practical application.
